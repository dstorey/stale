stale
=====

Web docs and other resources become stale over time. Help report and fix outdated content.

This repo doesnâ€™t have any source code. Use the bug tracker instead.

How to report
=============

File a bug in GitHub issues, one report per article/page/whatever. Tag the report with the issue type, such as technology used, type of problem (prefixes, outdated support info, oudated syntax, etc.) so that similar issues can be grouped together. 

Resolving issues
================

We should do outreach to get the content updated, or update it ourselves if it lives on a wiki. Once the content is updated, the bug can be closed.
